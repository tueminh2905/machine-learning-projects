The objective of this analysis is to predict employee turnover using Survival Analysis. This approach will help identify key factors, such as age and wage category (greywage), that influence how long employees stay with the company. By modeling time-to-event data, the analysis provides actionable insights for improving employee retention strategies, helping stakeholders make informed decisions to reduce churn and enhance workforce management.
